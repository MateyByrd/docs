> This project is open source, you can check out the code behind this wiki on GitHub at [nbelzer/wiki](https://github.com/nbelzer/wiki).

These docs are based upon [this wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) by Nikita Voloboev where he describes [everything he knows](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/everything-i-know). My plan is to set up a similar dictionary of knowledge for myself and possibly others.

For more information about me check out my [personal website](https://nickbelzer.me) or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/nbelzer).
